   Use this client RPC API package to connect to a SageAlert server and fire remote events.  There are three types of remote events that a client using this package can
   trigger:

   <ul>
      <li>Info: An informational alert</li>
      <li>Warning: A warning alert </li>
      <li>Error: An error alert</li>
   </ul>

   The RPC client must speak the same API version as the SageAlert server it's attempting to connect to.  This is enforced during client construction and an ApiVersionException
   is thrown if the client and server are not on the same API version.  If this is the case, you need to upgrade/downgrade one side or the other and ensure both are speaking
   the same API version.  The getClientApiVersion() and getServerApiVersion() methods in this library are available to help figure out which side is on what version in case of
   error.

  To use this library, simply ensure all the jar files in the jars directory of the zip package are included in your application's classpath.  Once that's done then connecting
  to a SageAlert server and firing alerts is rather straightforward.  The following Java application example shows just how easy this is:
  
  <pre>
    package sagealert.test;
    
    import com.google.code.sagetvaddons.sagealert.rpc.*;
    import java.net.URL;
    import java.net.MalformedURLException;
    
    public final class TestClient {
       static public void main(String[] args) {
          try {
             RemoteEventLauncher clnt = new RemoteEventLauncher(new URL("http://192.168.0.1/sagealert"), "my_jetty_id", "my_jetty_pwd");
             clnt.fireInfo("My first remote alert!", "This is the text of my first remote alert being sent to SageAlert.");
             System.out.println("Remote event fired successfully!");
          } catch(ApiVersionException e) {   // Thrown by the constructor if the client API version != the server API version
             e.printStackTrace();
          } catch(RpcException e) {          // Thrown by the call to fireInfo() if the RPC call fails
             e.printStackTrace();
          } catch(MalformedURLException e) { // Throw by the constructor if the given SageAlert URL is invalid
             e.printStackTrace();
          } catch(Exception e) {             // Catch any other error that may occur during program execution
             e.printStackTrace();
          }
       }
    }
  </pre>
